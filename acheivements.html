It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments <br>(client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, <br>such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.</p>

a software engineer and programmer will be a heart of technological world. “If you think about a camera, it really is the richest sensor available to us today at a very interesting price point,” he says. “Because of smartphones, camera and image sensors have become incredibly inexpensive, yet we capture a lot of information. From an image, we might be able to infer 25 signals today, but six months from now we’ll be able to infer 100 or 150 signals from that same image. The only difference is the software that’s looking at the image. And that’s why this is so compelling, because we can offer a very important core feature set today, but then over time all our systems are learning from each other. Every customer is able to benefit from every other customer that we bring on board because our systems start to see and learn more processes and detect more things that are important and relevant.”</p>
